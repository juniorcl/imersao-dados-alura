# Imersão Dados Alura

Notebooks used during the event about data science created by [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/).

## Event

A [Imersão Dados](https://www.alura.com.br/imersao-dados) (*Immersion Data*) was a event about data science and machine learning. In this event ENEM (National High School Exam) was used for data analysis. All the event ocurred in 5 days where each day was about a data analysis process.

* ### Day 1 - Your First Analysis of Education Data

    In this class there was the first contact with Python and the famous Pandas, it was used several features of this library to explore education data. In this data analysis, it was discover curiosities about ENEM registrants, formulate hypotheses and Box-plot distribution graphs to better understand some aspects of Brazilian education.

* ### Day 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis

    In this class, there was an advance with data analysis and data visualization was discussed, from good practices to the use of a new tool to generate more stylized graphics (seaborn).

* ### Day 3 - Distributions and COrrelations

    In this class it was covered heatmap and histograms graphics to undertand the data. Heatmap was used to watch the correlation among the scores. Otherwise, with histgrams and boxplot it was possible to understanding the distributions and outlies in the scores. 

* ### Day 4 - Machine Learning

* ### Day 5 - Pipeline and Model Validation
